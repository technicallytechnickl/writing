The specification of a system can be thought of like code meant to be compiled by designers and makers and resulting in the desired system.  Fully specifying a complex system can require thousands or even millions of individual requirements spread across multiple documents and levels of scope of the system.  Requirements generally should be broken down into individual lines where each line is atomic, complete, understandable, verifiable, and justified (traceable to a root). This documentation of requirements forms the foundation of the system that will be designed and built, and therefore must be approached as a critical phase of system development. If the requirements are not correct, complete, or used as the foundation for design decisions, then the resultant system will not pass validation and will not be fit for purpose.




This is sometimes impossible though as some requirements have interplay or require context from other requirements.  Requirements documentation for a complex system must occur in multiple phases as well.  The initial 


The requirements of a system must also be properly broken down and applied to the subsystems that make up the complex system.  In the case of a missile based air defense system, the following may be applicable questions in breaking down the time to intercept to subsystems:
- What is the time to detection by the radar? 
- What is the required interaction and allowed reaction time of the operator?
- What is the allowed time to intercept of the missile?

The answers to questions such as those will greatly impact the resultant performance and reliability of the system. Should the radar be designed to have more than one chance to detect a target, should the system be automated or require positive ID by the operator, will more than one missile be launched, and how late can the system wait before launching? The key to proper budgeting of this timeline, or in any other requirements setting is understanding the tr
