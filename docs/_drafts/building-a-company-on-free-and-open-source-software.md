title: Building a Company on Free and Open Source Software

As a former founder and technical lead at multiple early stage startups, I have built a tech stack from scratch more than once and across different eras of technologies. In this post I will share some of my experiences and lessons learned. 

## Starting Up
The starting up part of a startup is often a hectic jumble of learning and doing.  It's also a time of poverty, at least for the company, if not the founders as well. Therefore decision are (or should be) made based on how little money it will take, and how much flexibility the decision maintains. Cash is oxygen for a startup, at least so I've [heard](https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/62659-36#overview). 

Working from a couch is basically free, and doesn't tie you down to a lease.  A co-working space costs a bit more, but can be pay as you go. Getting that shiny new office will suffocate you. The same goes for infrastructure and tech stack. Signing up for a million monthly fees can tie you down monetarily due to licenses and technologically due to proprietary standards. Therefore, sticking with FOSS where possible, especially in the early days, can be a key to staying afloat.
