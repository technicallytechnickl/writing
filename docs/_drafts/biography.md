I am an expert in complex system definition, design, and implementation. A complex system crosses multiple functional specialties and requires an attention to early definition and design that isn't required in simpler systems. Examples of complex systems I have worked on include the [Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System](), [EAPS](), the [F-35](), the [EcoVent]() home comfort system, the Confer in home diagnostic device, Formlabs [Form 3](), the [Bevi V2](), and the ground breaking [Soluna data-centers](). Each of these systems is unique in their specific challenges, but what they have in common is the breadth of those challenges.  Each includes software from firmware to the cloud, data analytics, multiple complex electronic systems interacting, wireless communications, regulatory oversight, invention and technical risk, and a variety of mechanical engineering challenges. On each of those systems I was involved at the epicenter of those technical challenges, either learning from the best (Tony DeSimmone, Nick Bucci, Wayne Schroeder) or leading the charge. The breadth of my experience and exposure to such complex systems is critical to my understanding of the subtleties and non-linear interactions that occur in such systems.  My background has given me a unique capability in this area which I will continue to foster in my future career choices.

## The Beginning
When I was choosing majors, I chose Aerospace Engineering.  Mainly because it sounded cool, but also because I had watched Discovery Wings for years as a kid.  I knew all of the US military aircraft and was convinced I would go work at Lockheed and design them.  I was half right.  Aerospace Engineering was my entry point to complex systems engineering.  Aircraft, by definition, are highly complex and operate with little margin.  During my time at Texas A&M I learned skills ranging from Fortran 77 to creating a rocket INS (including control system) from scratch and flying it on our senior project. I was learning that I wasn't happy to focus on single details of a systems, but rather engineering how each part of the system contributed to solving the overall mission of the system.

Though the offer was a surprise, I decided to take my first full time role at Lockheed in Moorestown, NJ working on radars and fire control systems. Moving into electrical engineering (RADAR) seemed like a logical next step. I earned my Master's in EE while there, but the most valuable education was the exposure to incredibly complex mission critical systems and the requirements management process that enables them. Learning how requirements are set and met in such an environment created a solid foundation for the rest of my career. Through my time in Moorestown, I was able to observe and participate in the process of definition, design, development, verification, and validation of the incredibly complex Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense system.  Turns out that the most complex part of systems of this size is the organization of the people who define, design, build, test, and operate them.  I further honed my system definitions skills at two other locations in Lockheed on the EAPS missile defense system and the F-35 program, but the next major change to my career was becoming a co-founder at a startup.  

## The First Startup
I was lucky enough to meet the some amazing people while at Lockheed.  One of them, Dip Patel, is amazing enough that he quit a great career at Lockheed to pursue being a founder and to get his MBA. Once I heard the pitch, I was in.  The initial team included multiple fellow Lockheed engineers, and the vision was audacious for a startup.  We were going to build a system to control home HVAC systems, including room by room temperature control, that could be installed by end users and that wouldn't require any home remodeling.  The list of requirements implied by such a system is daunting.  The system must be affordable, but would require dozens of devices just to cover the whole home.  The system would have to be "plug and play" and require little maintenance (battery replacement), but must constantly measure the home environment, control airflow, and communicate with the rest of the system.  On top of those challenges, we had to raise money and build a company simultaneously.  It was a perfect chance to work with more amazing people and take on a full system myself.  

I started nights and weekends, literally in my garage making prototypes. Once we raised the first money, I quit at Lockheed and started working alternate weeks at home and in Boston at Techstars. This time period is a blur of learning, doing, and meeting amazing people. I'll write a more complete post on EcoVent at a later date, but a partial list of the challenges we overcame at EcoVent include:
	-Extreme breadth of engineering specialties (plastics, rapid prototyping, manufacturing, radio design, protocol design, IoT, HVAC, electro-mechanical design, full software stack (embedded devices, native mobile apps, cloud infrastructure, payment systems)
	-Outsourcing (China and domestic)
	-Organizational growth (hiring, firing, layoffs)
	-Startup/business operations and what survival really means

Eventually we sold EcoVent and it was time to move on. 

## Medical Devices
As I was exploring the local startup scene, I was approached by an acquaintance about a part time role in hardware engineering at a med-tech startup called Confer. The vision was compelling, affordable at home lab grade diagnostics for everyone. The engineering challenges were in electro-optics, micro-fluidics, IoT, and of course affordability. Another perfect opportunity to build a highly complex system from scratch with an amazing team. I started working part time creating prototypes and doing some feasibility calculations. I wasn't aware that this was really a job interview for their VP, Engineering role. I thankfully passed the test and was hired on to start building the engineering team. There was a small software team in place that I took over management of and grew, as well as adding key hires in mechanical and electrical engineering.  I applied my lessons learned from EcoVent and utilized outside consulting for the "commodity" engineering and our inside experts for the hard problems. Again, I'll make a longer post about Confer eventually, but new skills I had to learn or grow at Confer include:
	-Direct SW management
	-Science! (pippetting, lab procedures)
	-Microfluidic devices and actuation
	-Extreme optical detection
	-Haskell
	-Even more interaction with product management and design
	-New startup failure modes

We were successful in proving the technology and had a bright path planned to reach launch including our FDA approval.  However, personal issues and actions of our lead investor sunk Confer before it really got off the ground. Luckily Mounir was able to take the tech to []() and get it launched in a different package.

## Product Management
At EcoVent and Confer I was deep in engineering, team building, and manufacturing.  A lot of the happenings around me, though useful at the time, were a blur after the fact.  I wanted to take a step back and understand product development from another point of view after my Confer experience.  I was also ready to take a break from the on-the-edge life of a young startup.  I was fortunate to get an opportunity on the product team at Formlabs that checked all of these boxes. The Formlabs tech stack was as deep as either of my previous companies, but they were further along in sales, product lines, and team sizes. I approached product management from the direction of understanding the experience of customers first.  I printed constantly, tried all the materials, and attempted prints that may or may not have destroyed a printer or two. This experience would form my approach to product management for the rest of my tenure. I quickly learned that I would need to get in deep with the engineering team as well to affect any change in product development.
