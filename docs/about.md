# About Me

While there is more to me, this page will primarily focus on my career experiences. 

I hope to go through some of my career in detail in future posts, so I'll keep it short here.  I have degrees in Aerospace and Electrical Engineering.  I've worked on radar, missile fire control, requirements management for massive systems, home comfort, injection molding, radio protocols, advanced sensor technologies, optical technologies, medical devices, 3D printing (specifically SLA), product management, quality engineering, refrigeration, carbonation, data center design, SCADA control systems, and more.  My tool-set over the years has included CAD, finite element simulations, requirements and risk management tools, optical simulations, various programming languages and environments, and more. 

The pattern being that I enjoy building teams and solving complex technical problems.  If it has been solved properly before, there's not much point for me to work on it.  If there's a problem that needs solving and I don't know how yet, I can go learn and find the people who do know enough. 

I hope sharing some of my experiences can help others to make better decisions for themselves and maybe avoid some pitfalls where possible.
